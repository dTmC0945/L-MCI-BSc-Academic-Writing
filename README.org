** Requirements and the Learning Outcomes

- The student should not need any prior knowledge, however a brief knowledge
  of programming would be beneficial and knowing where the keyboard is on
  a computer is a plus.
- After completion, the student will have a good understanding of academic
  writing practices and learn to type typographically excellent documents.
